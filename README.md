# The Repository

* LINK TO LIVE REPOSITORY*

https://gregharris90.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/

- This repository is for a web application to use a 'Work Day Scheduler' to plan tasks for the average work day!

# User Story

- On the main page the user finds time slots to be populated with tasks for each hour, ranging from 9am to 5pm.

- Depending on the current hour of when the web application is being used the colors of the slots change.

- The colors for tasks operate as "grey" = past, "red" = present, and "future" = green. 

- They can then click on one of the text areas for the corresponding hour and enter a task. 

- To the right of this section is a "save button" which updates and logs the task to local storage.

- This means upon refreshing the page the user's tasks remain and are loaded into the appropiate time slots.

- Hopefully this helps the user better organize their work day!

# Overall Conclusion

- This homework assignment presented certain challenges with utilizing 3rd party APIs like Moment.js and then using local storage to setItems & getItems from the user for their tasks.

- Also building the display with HTML based on the provided CSS, while using Jquery/Bootstrap to build an interactive application and add functionality to the webpage. 

- It took me a little longer to finally get everything working, organized, and onto GitHub. But I'm glad I was able to get it done!
